            Why do I want to study this course?
        </h3>
        <p>
            The easy answer would be the obvious one: “Because I want to work as a Front-end developer!”. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Why specifically this course? Because I like what I have read about it. I like that it is set for 5 months and I think that along with personal studies on the side this will be a good path of getting to the job I want within a timeline I feel comfortable with. Most importantly it gives me the opportunity to study from home which is something high on my list of priorities.

            Because I was an amazing one in the past?

            Avoiding emojis, just know that was said with a smile and bright sparkling eyes because… Yes, that knowledge is completely outdated. From a time when code was written in notepad with no separate CSS, utilizing inline tags for font styling, "i" and "b", and "table" as the main layout tool, all written within the same HTML document. As such I have had to start close from scratch, but getting back into it, my love of programming remains. The interest and just that "spark of joy" when a code comes together, along with all the new possibilities! It is a reawakened passion and I love to learn! That and my drive is what will make me good in the future. This is something I really want and what I want is always worth the work and effort.

            My name Is Annelie Johansson Rova. I am originally from the north of Sweden and currently recide in beautiful Örebro. As I am writing this you find me in a very expansive time in my life. After years of other focus and priorities I am finally back at putting myself front and center. It took a lot of thinking to find my current goals but now that I have them I have all the drive to achieve them. Do not misinterpret my wish of reaching the goal of my “dream job” quickly. It in no way means that I think I will be “done” or don't wish to keep learning. I just prefer doing so while working in my chosen field and I don't mind a high tempo to get there faster. One of the main reasons Frontend and web development is as attractive to me, is for the future in a profession where I will never stop learning and evolving as a person.
            
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I have lived a life all over the socioeconomic spectrum, in different countries and exposed to a lot of different people and cultures. As such there are very few people I can't find common ground with and I work well with other people. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In a group I will easily take on a leading role; organize, plan and keep everyone working towards that common goal. At the same time I find it very comfortable to work under a structured leader, being able to focus on my own job and mine alone. My preferred job is one where I can work with a team, where everyone works independently withi a mutual project and as such I can be a cog in a wheel or drive the entire mechanism, so long as I am clear on what's on my table I am very flexible.
        </p>
        <p>
            I like working towards a deadline with the freedom to plan my own work and unless something unexpected comes up, like really bad health, I always reach them. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When it comes to my future after an education. I will want to find a job where I can work from home or other places rather than being tied to an office. As such I will be open to finding an employer anywhere in the country or even abroad, depending on how often they want me to come in to the office. Should I not find employment that way I am not a stranger to freelance and/or starting my own company, I know a few back-end developers that have started lifting the topic of possibly going into business together. Due to my work in sales, marketing and administration along with my previous experience in UX, design and photography I do view it as a potential solution. Though preferably I would like to find an employer and I believe I should have the contacts to do so, once I have the education to where I can guarantee the quality of my work.
        </p>
        <p>
            Networking is a strength of mine and in short: I am simply lacking the education to move forward and hope that maybe… possibly… fingers crossed… I could get said education through You?
